# NLP_Project_AI_Rewriting_Assistant

## Project Overview
Our project aims to build an AI-powered assistant that rewrites emails in different tones (formal, casual, persuasive, apologetic, assertive) while preserving the original meaning. We are leveraging transformer-based models (T5, GPT-4) to enable automatic tone adaptation, enhancing communication effectiveness.

## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
ðŸ”¹ Datasets Chosen:

Enron Email Dataset (Business Emails - Formal, Casual, Persuasive)
Hillary Clinton Email Dataset (Diplomatic & Formal Emails)
Customer Service Email Dataset (Apologetic & Persuasive Emails)
ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing Steps Completed:
âœ” Removed email metadata (headers, timestamps, signatures)
âœ” Normalized text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, contraction expansion)
âœ” Tokenized the content for processing
âœ” Merged all datasets into a unified preprocessed dataset

## 2. Model Development
ðŸ”¹ Baseline Model:
âœ” A Seq2Seq model with attention mechanism as a starting point

ðŸ”¹ Transformer-Based Models Selected:
âœ” T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) Fine-Tuning 
âœ” GPT-4 Fine-Tuning for Email Tone Adaptation

## 3. Model Training & Fine-Tuning
ðŸ”¹ Training Process:
âœ” Dataset split into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%)
âœ” Fine-tuning T5 on Hugging Face for different email tones
âœ” Initial results show promising text coherence and tone adaptation

ðŸ”¹ Reinforcement Learning Integration:
âœ” Implemented feedback collection mechanism (thumbs-up/down on generated emails)
âœ” Next step: Use feedback for model improvement

## 4. Evaluation Metrics Defined
âœ” BLEU Score - Measures similarity to human-written emails
âœ” ROUGE Score - Evaluates text overlap with reference emails
âœ” Human Evaluation - Assesses fluency, coherence, and tone accuracy
